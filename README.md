### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I am Gustavo Gonzalez, data science and analytics programmer with a masterâ€™s degree in Atmospheric
Sciences, a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics and a technical degree in computer science. My experience covers
database analysis, database merging, quality control, statistical analysis and visualization of results using
R, Shell Scripting, Python, SQL, Power BI and LaTeX. My passion for programming has led me to focus
on analytics and data science. I am also interested in developing apps and video games with Unity, CSharp
and Kotlin.
